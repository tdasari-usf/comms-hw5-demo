**HashTables** 

Hash Tables, also known as hashmaps, is a data structure that implements the storage of data in key value pairs. It uses a hash function to calculate an index which is also called hashcode. With the help of the index, data(values) are stored into an array of buckets. The hashcode determines which bucket the values fall into. At the time of lookup, the hashcode is calculated to retrieve the corresponding value.

Hashtables are extensively used for their faster retrievability. On average the time complexity of a hashtable is O(1). Ideally a hash function should  associate each value to a distinct key, but in cases where that is not possible a “collision” is caused. Collisions are handled using two techniques. The first one is open addressing, and the second is called Chaining.
